## Inaccessible Or Intentionally Not Downloaded

- No assigned source was fully inaccessible.
- Large benchmark corpora and multi-megabyte lists were intentionally not downloaded.
- Auto-Antislop `slop-forensics` was not copied from the submodule because equivalent prior capture already exists in `legacy/source-material/llm-slop-lists/slop-forensics/`.
